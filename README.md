We used 4 scripts to analyze our hypotheses

[01-data-wrangling.R](https://github.com/BIOL4110/Group-3-Group-Project/blob/main/r-scripts/01-data-wrangling.R) Features data cleaning and organization

[02-sst.R](https://github.com/BIOL4110/Group-3-Group-Project/blob/main/r-scripts/02-sst.R) All raster data analysis and transformation to dataframe

[03-hypothesis1.R](https://github.com/BIOL4110/Group-3-Group-Project/blob/main/r-scripts/03-hypothesis1.R) All code to do with answering hypothesis 1 and generating figures 

[04-hypothesis2.R](https://github.com/BIOL4110/Group-3-Group-Project/blob/main/r-scripts/04-hypothesis2.R) All code to do with answering hypothesis 2 and generating figures

unsed-script.R Features code we used along the way that did not help us answer our questions directly, but were useful to return to.
